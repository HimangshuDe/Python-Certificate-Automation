# Certificate Automation Program Using Python üöÄ

This program automates the generation of certificates, which is commonly used in schools or in college for publishing certificates of any merit or sports heat participants who stand a 1st, 2nd or 3rd position, in office for publishing the employee of the month/year! 

## ‚ùì How-to
1. We need to prepare our names.csv(or any filename of our choice) and attribute.txt(or any filename of our choice). 

    Click [here](github.com/HimangshuDe/Python-Certificate-Automation/tree/master/sample-files) for the sample files about preparing the required files or you can download and use those!

    **Note**: Make sure that the attributes.txt file is in the same format as in the sample file!!

## üéØ Troubleshooting!
* If we encounter any `FileNotFoundError` error, then try giving the full path of the file! 
* If we encounter any `cannot open resource`, then check for the font path in attributes.txt file, make sure it is correct! In windows, all the fonts are stored under `C:\Windows\Fonts\`
